* [humble] image_publisher: Fix loading of the camera info parameters on startup (backport `#983 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/983>`_) (`#996 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/996>`_)
  As described in
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/965 camera info
  is not loaded from the file on node initialization, but only when the
  parameter is reloaded.
  This PR resolves this issue and should be straightforward to port it to
  `Humble`, `Iron` and `Jazzy`.<hr>This is an automatic backport of pull
  request `#983 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/983>`_ done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).

* image_publisher: add field of view parameter (backport `#985 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/985>`_) (`#993 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/993>`_)
  Currently, the default value for focal length when no camera info is
  provided defaults to `1.0` rendering whole approximate intrinsics and
  projection matrices useless. Based on [this
  article](https://learnopencv.com/approximate-focal-length-for-webcams-and-cell-phone-cameras/),
  I propose a better approximation of the focal length based on the field
  of view of the camera.
  For most of the use cases, users will either know the field of view of
  the camera the used, or they already calibrated it ahead of time.
  If there is some documentation to fill. please let me know.
  This PR should be straightforward to port it to `Humble`, `Iron` and
  `Jazzy`.

* image_publisher: Fix image, constantly flipping when static image is published (backport `#986 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/986>`_) (`#988 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/988>`_)
  Continuation of
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/984.
  When publishing video stream from a camera, the image was flipped
  correctly. Yet for a static image, which was loaded once, the flip
  function was applied every time `ImagePublisher::doWork()` was called,
  resulting in the published image being flipped back and forth all the
  time.
  This PR should be straightforward to port it to `Humble`, `Iron` and
  `Jazzy`.<hr>This is an automatic backport of pull request `#986 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/986>`_ done by

2.2.0 (2020-07-27)
------------------
* Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions. (`#566 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/566>`_)
  * Replacing deprecated header includes with new HPP versions.
  * CI: Switching to official Foxy Docker container.
  * Fixing headers which don't work correctly.
* Opencv 3 compatibility (`#564 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/564>`_)
  * Remove GTK from image_view.
  It is no longer used at all in image_view.
  * Reinstate OpenCV 3 compatibility.
  While Foxy only supports Ubuntu 20.04 (and hence OpenCV 4),
  we still strive to maintain Ubuntu 18.04 (which has OpenCV 3).
  In this case, it is trivial to keep keep image_pipeline working
  with OpenCV 3, so reintroduce compatibility with it.
  * Fixes from review.
  * One more fix.
* Use newer 'add_on_set_parameters_callback' API (`#562 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/562>`_)
  The old API was deprecated in Foxy and since removed in https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1199.
* Remove redundant install call in CMakeLists.txt (`#555 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/555>`_)

2.0.0 (2018-12-09)

* port image_publisher on ROS2 (`#366 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/366>`_)
* Initial ROS2 commit.
* Contributors: Chris Ye, Michael Carroll

1.12.23 (2018-05-10)
--------------------
* fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error (`#318 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/318>`_)
  * fix 'VideoCapture' undefined symbol error
  The following error occured when trying to run image_publisher:
  [...]/devel/lib/image_publisher/image_publisher: symbol lookup error: [...]/devel/lib//libimage_publisher.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2cv12VideoCaptureC1Ev
  Probably, changes in cv_bridge reducing the OpenCV component dependencies led to the error. See
  https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/commit/8b5bbcbc1ce65734dc600695487909e0c67c1033
  This is fixed by manually finding OpenCV with the required components and adding the dependencies to the library, not just the node.
  * add image_publisher opencv 2 compatibility

* explicitly cast to std::vector<double> to make gcc6 happy
  With gcc6, compiling image_publisher fails with this error:
  ```
  /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
  /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:43: error: ambiguous overload for 'operator=' (operand types are 'sensor_msgs::CameraInfo\_<std::allocator<void> >::_D_type {aka std::vector<double>}' and 'boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>')
  camera_info\_.D = list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0);
  ```
  After adding an initial explicit type cast for the assignment,
  compiling fails further with:
  ```
  | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp: In member function 'virtual void image_publisher::ImagePublisherNodelet::onInit()':
  | /[...]/image_publisher/src/nodelet/image_publisher_nodelet.cpp:180:65: error: call of overloaded 'vector(boost::assign_detail::generic_list<int>&)' is ambiguous
  |      camera_info\_.D = std::vector<double> (list_of(0)(0)(0)(0)(0));
  ```
  Various sources on the internet [1, 2, 3] point to use the
  `convert_to_container` method; hence, this commit follows those
  suggestions and with that image_publisher compiles with gcc6.

* address gcc6 build error
  With gcc6, compiling fails with `stdlib.h: No such file or directory`,
  as including '-isystem /usr/include' breaks with gcc6, cf.,
  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70129.
